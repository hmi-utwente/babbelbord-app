 # Welcome to the Babbelbord project!
Here goes a description of the project

## Technology stack
Here we describe the frameworks we use and perhaps add the image that shows how the whole system works.

## Get started with development
First, install the dependencies using the terminal. If you do not have npm installed on your system, you can refer to [this tutorial](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm). After installing npm, you also need to install bower (another package manager for dependencies).

```
npm install bower -g
```

Now it is time to install all the dependencies needed for the project:
```
npm install 
bower install
```

To work on the app locally while developing, type this in the terminal:

```
DEBUG=babbelbord:* npm start
```
